# Layouts

Layouts are a sort of scaffolding for your application. They contain the page designs as well as components relevant to the design such as the header, main menu, footer, etc.

It is recommended to add them at module-level to maintain flexibility. If you need multiple layouts per module, you should probably rethink your code division.
